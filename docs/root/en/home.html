                    <e-code>capitalized( DOCUMENT )</e-code>

                    The reference <a href="#component">API Component</a> at the bottom
                    of this page and the navigation panel of the house both provide access
                    to the entire documentation.

                        In the upper navigation panel, there is a house
                        icon that can be clicked. Alternatively, you can just swipe
                        your finger from edge to edge from left to right if your device
                        supports touch manipulation of the display.
                        By doing this, the menu is displayed.

                    An experimental project called <e-code>capitalized( DOCUMENT )</e-code>
                    uses json data to illustrate embedded data.
                    Using ready-made elements that may be added
                    to your web sites, graphs are visualized.

                    I created a PieChart graph using an
                    <a href="?piechartElement">element</a> that
                    shows the typical download speed in Mbps as an illustration.

                    Using the buttons on the PieChart graphic's bottom,

                            The base of Java-script is referred to as Vanilla.
                            Modules from outside sources are thus not implemented
                            in projects with this categorization.
